# Data
## Product app data
All items will have a: -
* Category
* Title
* Description
* Rating in terms of 1 to 5 stars
* Price
* Size if applicable (for rings only)
The only items that need sizes are the rings. The category containing rings has sizes. The category containing sale items does not because most items in it will not have a size. Individual rings with their size in the description will be included in the sale. This applies to the bag content.
| Field name | Data type |
| ---------- | --------- |
| Title | Short text |
| Price (Â£) | Number |
| Size (if applicable) | text |
| Rating | Number 1-5 with decimal point |
| Category | Short text|

All items will be assigned an SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) identifier, unique for each distinct product that can be purchased.

The site will have the ability to search words in the title and description of each item for key words such as metal type, gem name, colours, shapes.

The site will contain categories of jewellery. Main categories include necklaces, bracelets, rings, brooches, earrings, combinations (matching necklace, earrings and ring) and sale items The products are all sorted these categories (some will be added to the sale category)

The site has CRUD ability (Create, Read, Update and Delete) because the superusers of the site need to be able to add, update and delete products on the site, plus everyone needs to be able to read data on the site (shoppers as well as superusers).

## Databases
Django officially supports five database backends: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and Oracle.

The type used in this project is PostGreSQL when deployed, although the database used during development is SQLite. Product data was transferred between the databases during the deployment process, see the deployment section for details on how this was done. PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system that uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads. PostgreSQL runs on all major operating systems, has been ACID-compliant since 2001.

In computer science, ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) is a set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee data validity despite errors, power failures, and other mishaps. In the context of databases, a sequence of database operations that satisfies the ACID properties (which can be perceived as a single logical operation on the data) is called a transaction.

PostgreSQL comes with many features aimed to help developers build applications, administrators to protect data integrity and build fault-tolerant environments, and help manage data no matter how big or small the dataset. In addition to being free and open source, PostgreSQL is highly extensible. Data types can be defined, custom functions built out, even code written from different programming languages without recompiling the database.

One of the most powerful parts of Django is the automatic admin interface. It reads metadata from models to provide a quick, model-centric interface where trusted users can manage content on the site. The adminâs recommended use is limited to an organizationâs internal management tool. Itâs not intended for building the entire front end around. To create a user to login with, the createsuperuser command was used. By default, logging in to the admin requires that the user has the is_staff attribute set to True.

### Terms & Conditions
#### What is a Terms and Conditions Agreement?
A terms and conditions agreement outlines the website administratorâs rules regarding user behaviour, and provides information about the actions the website administrator can and will perform. Your terms and conditions text is a contract between your website and its users. In the event of a legal dispute, arbitrators will look to this agreement to determine whether each party acted within their rights.

Terms and conditions are not required by law, but are extremely important to the long-term success and viability of your website. Terms and conditions give you control over your site and legal reinforcement if users try to take advantage of your operations.

Creating the best terms and conditions page possible will protect your business from the following: Abusive users â Terms and conditions allow you to establish what constitutes appropriate activity on your site or app, so you can remove abusive users and content that violates your guidelines. Intellectual property theft â Asserting your claim to the creative assets of your site in your terms and conditions will prevent ownership disputes and copyright infringement. Potential litigation â If a user lodges a legal complaint against your business, showing that they were presented with clear terms and conditions before they used your site will help you immensely in court.

In short, terms and conditions give you control over your site and legal reinforcement if users try to take advantage of your operations.

## Manufacture

Our goods are hand crafted to the highest standard. We strive to create quality items for every budget. We use a large range of raw materials, particularly gems. This makes our jewellery pieces stand out from the crowd, they are so different from pieces bought from well-known, larger companies.

We hope you enjoy your purchases from us!

# Bugs and improvements
## Problem: - toasts not working
It was difficult to get toasts working in this project. All the Bootstrap components are from Bootstrap 5.1 and it is important to keep all components and links consistent. The solution to the problem is shown in this [link](docs/Toasts.pdf).
## Improvement to image layout
There is a difficulty with very different image sizes for items which could sometimes escape the confines of one product entry and bleed across into other product entries. This was solved by setting limits on the width of each image while restricting the height to the same value for all images. This is an easy problem to fix but makes a big difference to the appearance of the website and takes care of the difficulty of large variations in ratio of height and width of images.
